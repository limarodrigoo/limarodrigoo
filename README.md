## ðŸš€ About Me
<p>Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Rodrigo, a back-end developer who started about 1 year ago as an intern. I mainly work with Node.js, Python, Express, GraphQL, and RabbitMQ. I'm also keen on the Hexagonal architecture.</p>

<p>I was recently promoted to Junior Back-end Developer, and since then, I've been diving even deeper into this amazing world of programming.</p>

<p>I'm always up for new challenges and love learning new things. If you're working on cool projects or just want to chat, hit me up! Let's build something awesome together! ðŸ’»âœ¨</p>
