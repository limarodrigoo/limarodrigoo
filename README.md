## ðŸš€ About Me
<p>After I graduated on accounting I realized that it didnâ€™t make me happy so, I decided to change careers. Since I was a kid I found myself affictionated about techs, computers. One of my first photos as a child is of me trying to play with a computers mouse!</p> 
<p>But it was while I was writing my final paper on my accounting university that I saw how programming could help me. At that point I didnâ€™t have the time to learn all about it and use it on my final paper, but I started looking at it as something that I could add to my skills. </p>
<p>After that I lived abroad at Liverpool to learn English and accomplish one of my dreams: live in Europe and meet new people and cultures from all over the world.</p> 
<p>Now, here I am, chasing another dream that I have since doing my final paper: become a developer!</p>
