# Hi, I'm Rodrigo! 👋


## 🚀 About Me
After graduate on accounting and didn't be happy with it I decided to change.
Since a kid I was affictionated for new techs and programming, one of my first 
photos as a child is me trying to play with a mice! But it was during my final 
paper on my accounting university I saw a difficulty that programming could help me. 
But with my expertise at that time and my lack of time I just had time to read a 
programming book for beggirner, that put programming on my radar, but could't use it
at that moment!
After that I did a exchange at Liverpool to learn english and accomplish one of my 
dreams. Living in Europe and meeting people and cultures from all the 4 corners 
of the world.
Now i'm seaking another dream that i had while doing me final paper. 
Be a developer!
